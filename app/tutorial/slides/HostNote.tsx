            <p>EventStar will fully replace Costi Online&#39;s unlisted Newsroom feature. It offers enhanced security, improved organization, and a design tailored specifically for event invitations. Guest lists and RSVP statuses will be displayed more clearly, and EventStar will integrate directly with Google Calendar, making it easy to keep track of events. Over time, EventStar will introduce many unique features specifically designed for friends.</p>
            <p className="mt-3">For group events for over 3 people, I will exclusively use this program for invites and reminders, as it is far easier for me to coordinate through here than texting individually.</p>
            <p className="mt-2">While EventStar is in development, I will continue to support Costi Online and have no plans to discontinue it.</p>
