            <p>EventStar will fully replace Costi Online&#39;s unlisted Newsroom feature. It offers enhanced security, improved organization, and a design tailored specifically for event invitations. Guest lists and RSVP statuses will be displayed more clearly, and EventStar will integrate directly with Google Calendar, making it easy to keep track of events. Over time, EventStar will introduce many unique features specifically designed for friends.</p>
