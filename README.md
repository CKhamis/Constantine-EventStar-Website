# Constantine EventStar
EventStar is a brand new service developed by Constantine Khamis that will organize event information, automate invitation reminders, act as a rating systems for restaurants, and much more.

## Features
While EventStar is still in active construction, here is a short list of features you can expect now or in the future:

### Plan, Track, and Check into Events
With EventStar, members can see the events they are invited to, respond to whether they will attend, and view other members' responses. They can also access the full history of events they have attended or plan to attend at any time.

### Track and Earn Points
EventStar offers its own reward service just for using the platform. Points can be redeemed for various rewards, such as a high five, a goodnight text, or even the chance to gamble and double your points!

### Your Very own Membership Card
Certain EventStar members will receive a custom-made NFC-compatible membership card. This card can be used to validate attendance at events. Use this card to check in instead of entering your 4-digit PIN in the EventStar terminal.

### Rate Spots with Friends
The spots feature allows you and others to rate and add locations for selection during regular hangouts. You can rate places on a 0-100 scale, apply a veto restriction, and see how other members have rated a particular location.
